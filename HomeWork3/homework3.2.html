  <h1>Pink</h1>
  <p>Pink is a pale tint of red, the color of the pink flower. It was first used as a color name in the late 17th century.
    According to surveys in Europe and the United States, pink is the color most often associated with charm, politeness,
    sensitivity, tenderness, sweetness, childhood, femininity, and romance. A combination of pink and white is associated
    with innocence, whereas a combination of pink and black links to eroticism and seduction.In the 21st century, pink is
    seen as a symbol of femininity, though it has not always been seen this way. In the 1920s, light red, which is similar
    to pink, was seen as a color that reflected masculinity.</p>
